Live Robots
==========
 
Live Robots, is a educative project designed to create robots with Behaviors.
The project will be developed using the educative platform Lego Mindstorms EV3.

## Brity project ##

Brity is a project designed to develop EV3 robot and java software.
Robot will use a FSM with SCXML to model behaviours.

This example is an alternative to use Subsumption Architecture to model behaviours in Robots.

## Modeling behaviors with LeJOS ##

One goal of this project is the research about behavior modelling with Java.
Currently, the alternatives are:

FSM
HFSM
Subsumption
